## Welcome to TwitchMon's Project Site

The purpose of this Python application is to provide a quick an easy way to see your favorite Twitch streamers without scrolling through a list of them on the site, especially if you follow hundreds/thousands.

The following image depicts the running application.  You add the streamers you want to monitor for.
