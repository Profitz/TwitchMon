## Welcome to TwitchMon's Project Site

The purpose of this Python application is to provide a quick an easy way to see your favorite Twitch streamers without scrolling through a list of them on the site, especially if you follow hundreds/thousands.

The following image depicts the running application.  You add/delete the streamers you want to monitor for.
If they are live, you'll  see their name's appear on under the LIVE Channel's frame.
Every 30 seconds it will check your list and show who is live.

TwitchMon is very easy to use.
1.  Download the .zip and uncompress it.
2.  Run the twitchmon.exe
3. Add your favorite streamer(s)
4. Click 'Start Monitoring' button

It's set to always be on top as a window.  I like to move it off to a side monitor and glance up when I see a change.
