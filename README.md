# TwitchMon - Your Favorite LIVE Streamer Monitor
A simple Twitch monitor of your favorite streamers going live.

## Functionality
This does not use the Twitch API but rather the request pkg to query the http page(s) of your favorite streamer(s) looking for elements to determine if the page is life.
This removes the need to have to inject client/secret keys for Twitch API usage.
